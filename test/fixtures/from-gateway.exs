The idea is to keep this disabled in Prod for a while for\r\nnormal users.\r\n\r\n## To Test\r\n- [ ] Login as a teacher\r\n- [ ] Login as fake student with rtc enabled (`student-mc-testRtc`)\r\n- [ ] Login as a real student using the iframe trickery mentioned above\r\n- [ ] Connect to both students\r\n- [ ] Notice your audio will always be available on one of the students at any given time\r\n- [ ] Switch between each student, you will likely hear some faint clicking as the audio inputs switch\r\n- [ ] Login as a student without flash (another real or any other fake student)\r\n- [ ] Ensure you hear no audio when on the flash student's screen unless you are pushing the talk button\r\n\r\n### Note: The `Talk` button on RTC chats is superficial and has no actual behavior\r\n",

I don't necessarily mind the logging but i'm also not sure where it comes out or at what level, and some of it seems pretty informative (whereas some of the rest seems like debugging code).  If it's all useful and intelligible, then by all means, but I had a difficult time figuring out whether it was supposed to be there or not.  Example:\r\n\r\n```\r\neasyrtc.connect(config.appName, function(id){\r\n  console.log(`Now connected to ${id} as ${appData.user.username}`);\r\n}, function(errorCode, errorText){\r\n  console.log(\"Connection error \", errorCode, \" text: \", errorText);\r\n});\r\n```\r\nThese logs look good!  Not sure if they should be `log` or `debug` or whatevs, but they're definitely informative.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconsole.log(\"boostrapped\");\r\n```\r\nThis one looked like it might just be debugging that got left in.  If it's useful and current, can we make the messages more informative, like 'Audio client was bootstrapped successfully with webrtc'\r\n\r\n3) I understand the desire to not back up PR's, but I wonder if this could have been done more granularly.  It may not even be the number of things tackled here as much as adding the client all in one big commit (and not understanding the client very well) that made it feel complex.  (nothingtodohere), just posing the comment.\r\n",

SUCCESS!!!\r\n\r\n**Why Does This Work?**\r\nUnder the Customer model there is a `after_update` callback that checks to see if the Customer's `status` attribute is set to _inactive_, and if so it will go through the fix I've added in the Pull Request mentioned above.
